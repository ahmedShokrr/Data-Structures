## Projects

### Project 1: Telephone System Simulator

Simulates the operation of a telephone system for a small business. Implements a single-service queue to handle incoming calls and gathers statistics about call processing.

### Project 2: Website Indexer using AVL Trees

Creates an index of popular websites and their IP addresses using an AVL Tree. Provides functionalities to display the index, search for URLs, and search for IP addresses.
